# NASA-Themed Website - Web Development Project
This project is a NASA-themed website created as a practice exercise for an introductory Web Development course. Designed to demonstrate foundational web skills, the website’s content is in Croatian and explores NASA’s missions, history, and partnerships. The homepage provides an overview, with hyperlinks leading to relevant sections on NASA’s official website.

As per course guidelines, this project incorporates multiple frameworks, including Bootstrap and Flexbox, to enhance structure and responsiveness. Additional pages include "About Us," "Contact," "News" (featuring updates relevant to mid-2022), and a "Web Shop" page. Visual elements, such as an integrated planet graphic, add a modern touch to the site’s design.

Overall, this was a first practical venture into building a fully functional website, offering an invaluable hands-on learning experience in web development.
